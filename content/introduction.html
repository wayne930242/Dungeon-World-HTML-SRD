<h1>簡介</h1>
<div id="Introduction">
<h2>地城世界 (Dungeon World）</h2>
<p class="NoIndent">地城世界是奇幻冒險的世界。是個充斥著魔法、神魔、善惡、律法與混沌的世界。勇敢的英雄闖蕩於大地上最危險的角落，追求財富與榮耀。</p>
<p>在地城世界中有形形色色的冒險者。精靈、人類、矮人與半身人都有屬於自己的英雄。他們之中有身穿鐵甲，無人能敵的戰場猛獸；有的則神秘莫測，呼喚並驅使著魔法的力量。這些尋求財寶與榮耀的，有神聖的牧師、有奸巧的盜賊、有強大的聖武士、還有更多更多。</p>
<p>然而，冒險並不只有輕鬆的英雄主義與高尚的英勇行徑。每當遊俠帶著他的朋友穿越古老森林時，數以百計的危險虎視眈眈地等著咬掉他的頭顱。或許，等待著他們的是流著口水的哥布林部隊，又或許，他們行經的是居住著灰衣女巫的詛咒之森？亦或者，一整群怨靈正飢渴地尋找著用以還魂的肉身屍體。可怕嗎？當然，但是財寶也在那裏。在危險深處，無數被世人遺忘的黃金珠寶和魔法散落在你所熟悉世界的陰暗夾縫之間。除了堅定勇敢的英雄們之外，又有誰能夠取回它們？</p>
<p>你和你的朋友<b>就是</b>那些英雄。你們踏足他人無法或不願涉足的險地。怪誕之物潛居於這個世界──你準備好面對牠們了嗎？</p>
<hr/>
<h2>吟遊詩人 (The Bard）</h2>
<p class="NoIndent">冒險者之詩乃是不斷向前之路，是錢幣與戰鬥的榮光。在那些鄉農滿座的酒館中被傳唱的故事，總有些許真實，對吧？那些鼓舞農民與國親的歌謠──那些撫慰野獸或讓人瘋狂的歌謠──必定其來有自。</p>
<p>當個詩人吧。來，帶著你的巧舌與機智。你說故事，你唱歌謠。一名尋常樂手只會複誦，而真正的吟遊詩人活在其中。繫上你的靴子吧，高貴的演說家。磨利那把小刀，接受呼喚。總得有人要與那些暴徒、惡棍與即將成為英雄的人們並肩作戰。又有誰比你更能傳誦自己的英雄故事？</p>
<p>沒有別人了。來吧。</p>
<h2>牧師 (The Cleric）</h2>
<p class="NoIndent">地城世界的大地就是個被神遺棄的爛攤子。在安全與被祝福的文明之間，佈滿了走動的死屍、各種的野獸、跟廣袤的超自然之地。那是個神不存在的世界，而這也正是為何需要你的原因。</p>
<p>將神之榮光帶給異教徒不只是你的本性──更是你的使命。你持著劍、槌和咒法宣教，劈開粗野的愚蠢之心，植入神聖之籽。有人說，最好讓神常伴你心。你知道那都是狗屁。神只住在刀鋒之上。</p>
<p>向這個世界證明，誰才是它的主宰。</p>
<h2>德魯伊 (The Druid）</h2>
<p class="NoIndent">環視火堆周圍，這些人滿是城市的塵埃與汗味，是什麼將你帶到這些人身邊？或許是慈愛吧──你是否如同母熊照看她的幼崽保護著他們？他們現在是你這群的嗎？你可真有群奇怪的兄弟姊妹。不管你有怎樣的靈感，沒有你銳利的感官和更銳利的獠爪，他們註定不會成功。</p>
<p>你屬於神聖之所；你出生於母土，你的身上戴著她的靈魂之印。你可能也曾有過凡人的生活，或許你也像他們曾居於都城，如今卻已非如此。你拋棄了停滯的定型。聆聽你盟友對他們所雕神像的祈禱，聆聽他們的宗教寓言故事，講述他們將在早已被你拋棄的破爛小鎮中找回的榮耀。</p>
<p>他們的諸神只是年幼的孩童，他們的鋼鐵只是虛假的保護。你走在古老的路上，披大地為衣。你會拿取屬於你的財寶，但你是否會走上與他們相同的路呢？只有時間知道。</p>
<h2>戰士 (The Fighter）</h2>
<p class="NoIndent">一份爛差事－－每天的命得用身上與手上的技巧來討，危險則不小心又來到。當這次你在巴克斯伯格（Barsberg）的酒吧為他們兩肋插刀的時候，沒有人為此吹奏金牛角。當這次你將他們從瘋狂深淵的邊緣，將還在尖叫的他們拖出來的時候，沒有天使為此合唱。沒有。
</p>
<p>忘了他們吧。</p>
<p>你這麼做，是為了膽識與榮耀，是為了戰鬥的呼嘯與那熾熱的鮮血。你是鐵打的野獸。你的朋友或許帶著鋼鑄之鋒，然而，戰士，你本身就是鋼了。當你的旅伴正在野外營火旁抱怨他們的傷口，你驕傲地背著自己的傷疤。</p>
<p>你即是鐵壁－－所有危險都向你撲來。到頭來，你還是最後一個站著的。</p>
<h2>聖武士（The Paladin）</h2>
<p class="NoIndent">地獄正在等著。或寒冰，或烈火，或地城世界中那些該死的罪人們所應得的懲罰，構成在此的永恆折磨。殘虐或者救贖，一切由你。神聖之士，戰爭機器，神與光的聖堂武士，對嗎？牧師或許在夜裡向天界上蒼祈禱。戰士或許以「善」之名揮舞利劍。但只有你知道，何謂善」。</p>
<p>眾神之眼，之手，之甜美殺戮，這就是你。你的贈禮乃是正道與美德－－乃是正義，乃是洞見。你有一種同伴所欠缺的，純粹之意念。</p>
<p>所以引導這些愚者吧，聖武士。擔負起你的聖潔使命，將救贖帶到這個破爛世界。</p>
<p>敗者毋怨悽慘，對吧？</p>
<h2>遊俠（The Ranger）</h2>
<p class="NoIndent">與你同行的，這些城市小孩。他們是否聽見了狼的吠叫？是否感受到了東方荒涼沙漠之風的呼嚎？是否能如你那樣以弓刃狩獵？當然他媽的沒有。那就是為什麼他們需要你。</p>
<p>嚮導。獵人。荒野生物。還不只。你在荒野或許一向孤獨，然而一些更偉大之物的呼喚，將你與這些都市人的命－－要說是命運也可以－－連繫在一起。他們或許勇敢。或許強大健壯。但只有你了解這兩者間的秘密。</p>
<p>沒有你，他們就得迷路。在鮮血與黑暗之中燒出條小路吧，神行客。</p>
<h2>The Thief</h2>
<p class="NoIndent">You’ve heard them, sitting around the campfire. Bragging about this battle or that, or about how their gods are smiling on your merry band. You count your coins and smile to yourself—this is the thrill above all. You alone know the secret of Dungeon World: filthy, filthy lucre.</p> 
<p>Sure, they give you lip for all the times you’ve snuck off alone, but without you, every one of them would have been dissected by a flying guillotine or poisoned straight to death by some ancient needle trap. So let them complain. When you’re done with all this delving you’ll toast their heroes’ graves.</p>
<p>From your castle. Full of gold. You rogue.</p>
<h2>The Wizard</h2>
<p class="NoIndent">Dungeon World has rules. Not the laws of men or the rule of some petty tyrant. Bigger, better rules. You drop something—it falls. You can’t make something out of nothing. The dead stay dead, right?</p>
<p>Oh, the things we tell ourselves to feel better about the long, dark nights.</p>
<p>You’ve spent so very long poring over those tomes of yours. Conducting experiments that nearly drove you mad and casting summonings that endangered your very soul. For what? For power. What else is there? Not just the power of King or Country but the power to boil a man’s blood in his veins. To call on the thunder of the sky and the churn of the roiling earth. To shrug off the rules the world holds so dear.</p>
<p>Let them cast their sidelong glances. Let them call you “warlock” or “diabolist.” Who among them can hurl fireballs from their eyes?</p>
<p>Yeah. Didn’t think so.</p></div>
<h1>Why?</h1>
<p class="NoIndent">Why play Dungeon World?</p>
<p>First, to see the characters do <strong>amazing things</strong>. To see them explore the unexplored, slay the undying, and go from the deepest bowels of the world to the highest peaks of the heavens. To see them caught up in momentous events and grand tragedies.</p>
<p>Second, to see them <strong>struggle together</strong>. To gather as a party despite their differences and stand united against their foes, or to argue over treasure, debate battle plans, and join in righteous celebration over a victory hard-won.</p>
<p>Third, because <strong>the world still has so many places to explore</strong>. There are unlooted tombs and dragon hoards dotting the countryside just waiting for quick-fingered and strong-armed adventurers to discover them. That unexplored world has plans of its own. Play to see what they are and how they’ll change the lives of our characters.</p>
<h1>How to Use This Book</h1>
<p class="NoIndent">This book is going to teach you how to play Dungeon World. If you’re going to be the GM, you’re going to need to read the whole thing, though you can skim through the monster stats for now and save the Advanced Delving chapter for later. Try printing the play aids too, they’ll help you see what’s most important. If you’re a player, you might not need to read more than Playing the Game—a lot of the rules in Dungeon World will be contained in the character sheets you use during the game itself. You’ll come back to the text a few times throughout your game to refer to certain rules, but it should be a rare occasion.</p>
<h1>Setting Up</h1>
<p class="NoIndent">To play Dungeon World, you’ll need to gather yourself and 2–5 friends. A group of 4 to 6, including you, is best. Choose one person to be the Game Master (GM）. Everyone else will be players, taking the role of the characters in the game (we call these the player characters or PCs）. As you play, the players say what their characters say, think, and do. The GM describes everything else in the world.</p>
<p>You can play a single session or string together multiple sessions into a campaign. Plan accordingly if you plan on playing a campaign, maybe setting aside a night of the week to play. Each session will usually be a few hours and you’ll be able to start playing right away within the first session.</p>
<p>You’ll need to print some materials. Before you start a new game, find or print off at least:</p>
<ul><li>A few copies of the basic and special moves</li>
<li>One copy of each class sheet</li>
<li>One copy each of the cleric and wizard spell sheets</li>
<li>One copy of the adventure sheet and GM moves</li>
<li>Miscellanea such as: pens and pencils, scrap paper for maps and notes, maybe some index cards</li></ul>
<p class="NoIndent">Everyone at the table will need something to write with and some six-sided dice. Two dice is the minimum but two dice per player is a good idea.</p>
<p>You’ll also need some specialized dice: four-sided, eight-sided, ten-sided and twelve-sided. One of each is enough but more is better: you won’t have to pass them around so much.</p>
<h1>What’s Dungeon World Like to Play?</h1>
<p class="NoIndent">Playing Dungeon World is all about finding out what happens when your characters encounter dangerous and exciting monsters, strange ruins, and unusual people on their quest for gold and glory. It’s a conversation between the players and the GM—the GM tells the players what they see and hear in the world around them and the players say what their characters are thinking, feeling, and doing. Sometimes those descriptions will trigger a move—something that’ll cause everyone to stop and say “time to roll the dice to see what happens.” For a moment everyone hangs on the edges of their seats as the dice clatter to a stop. Tension and excitement are always the result, no matter how the dice land.</p> 
<p>As you play your characters they’ll change from their adventures and gain experience while learning about the world, overcoming monsters, and gathering riches. You’ll discover how they feel about each other and where their moral compass points them. When they accrue enough experience they’ll gain levels, becoming more powerful and having more options to explore.</p>
<p>You can play Dungeon World with the same group, session to session, over a long series of adventures, watching your characters change and grow together. You can play it as a self-contained game in a single-session, too. Whether a long campaign or a one-shot, Dungeon World’s rules are here to guide you and help you create a world of fantasy adventure. Time to get out there and explore it!</p>
